# Scripts for Introduction to PowerShell 7 Book

## Introduction

This repository holds the master scripts for Thomas Lee's PowerShell 7 book from Wiley.

This site is, until publication, a work in progress. 
The URL for the book is: https://www.amazon.com/PowerShell-7-Pros-Thomas-Lee/dp/1119644720
There are likely errors and missing or extra content here. 
Post publication should settle down!

## What's In This Repository

The book contains a large number of scripts to demonstrate PowerShell 7 in use.
You can download these to avoid having to retype them.
Post publication, you can download them from the Wiley website.
I plan to update this page as soon as I have that URL and can confirm it is working.
As an alternative, you may download the scripts from this repository.

## Repository Contents

This repository contains a folder for the scripts for each chapter:

* Chapter 1 - Setting up a PowerShell 7 Environment
* Chapter 2 - Compatibility with Windows PowerShell
* Chapter 3 - Managing AD DS
* Chapter 4 - Managing your network infrastructure
* Chapter 5 - Managing storage
* Chapter 6 - Managing shared data
* Chapter 7 - Managing printing
* Chapter 8 - Managing Hyper-V
  
The copies here on GitHub are my working copies.
Prior to publication - they are definitely a work in progress and can change.
Use at your own risk.

Once the book is published and the Wiley site URL known, a release is declared.
Post publication, updates to this repository are based on errors that are discovered.And of course, use at your own risk.

This repository also contains a Goodies folder in which are some extra scripts that did not make the book. These are for you to play with.
These 'goodies' also show things you can do with PowerShell that I did not have room for.
I also provide scripts and snippets that help you work with the VM network used in this book.
For example, there's a default profile for all the VM copies of VS Code and script to set this all up. 
Needless to say, use the goodies folder at your own risk

## Issues

Please file issues on any problems found with the scripts here.
